                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <h3>Gym Trainer</h3>
                <p>The workouts are fun, the fellow members are inspiring, the workouts are led by personal trainers who
                    give hands on instant feedback and adjustments during the workouts and just the right amount of
                    encouragement. The music is blaring and the atmosphere is awesome. You will not do the same workout
                    twice and if you go you will see the results no question. It’s a life changing gym experience and I
                    recommend it highly to all my fiends and family.
                    By far the best facility around. This new location is mint from the staff, to the equipment, to the
                    facility itself. From the ownership, to management, to the trainers, by far the nicest and most
                    knowledgeable staff in the business today. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend (GN) to anyone. I am
                    certainly satisfied thus far and have been blown away by my experience at this new facility

                    <h2>Sports Training</h2>
                    <p>There is a quote ‘A Sound Body Has a Sound Mind’. That proves that if you want to be happy
                        inside, then you need to have good physical health. Now there are lots of rules for good health.
                        One of these rules is physical exercise. Now we don’t get enough opportunity to go to the gym
                        and do physical exercises. Still, we have lots of opportunities to do that. We can play sports
                        for that. Sports are the best physical exercises for us. Mostly outdoor games like Cricket,
                        Football, and Hockey is the best option. So to improve health, sports have lots of importance in
                        our life.</p>

                    <h2>Bicycle Training</h2>
                    <p>The 10-week plan will build your aerobic base, starting with muscular strength and a focus on
                        cadence, which will boost your resistance to fatigue. The second half of the programme uses
                        low-intensity sessions to improve your body's ability to use fat as a power source, and then
                        higher aerobic efforts to improve overall fitness.

                        You'll need to commit around 8-10 hours per week to complete the programme, which includes a
                        small amount of off-bike cross-training.</p>

                    <h2>Games Training</h2>
                    <p>We will start with a small introduction to games and sports. Sporting activities require a lot of
                        physical activity. It involves running and lifting. During sports, the body is continuously
                        engaged. Games may require the individual to carry physical activities or can be done by staying
                        indoors. Sports and games have a lot of health benefits.</p>
